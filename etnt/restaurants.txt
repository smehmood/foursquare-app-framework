Trans fat is sprinkled throughout the menu while nearly every other chain in the fast-food industry has ditched it. What’s the holdup, A&W? Their side dishes are the most punishing things on the menu.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/a-and-w		A&W
With the 1,700-calorie Riblets Basket, 1,310-calorie Oriental Chicken Salad, and 2,510-calorie Appetizer Sampler, the one bright spot is the Under 550 Calories menu, despite some sodium issues.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/applebees		Applebee's
Arby’s offers a long list of sandwiches with fewer than 500 calories, including a trio of roast chicken sandwiches. Problem is, there’s an even longer list of sandwiches with more than 500 calories.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/arbys		Arby's
Muffins and bagels are two of the worst health food imposters. Although "whole grain," "blueberry," and "banana nut" sound healthy, their benefits are outweighed by their caloric overloads.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/atlanta-bread-company		Atlanta Bread Company
Use the on-site nutritional kiosks to seek out one of dozens of paths to a sensible meal. Opt for one of the excellent soups or salads, or pair two smaller items from the All Portions menu.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/au-bon-pain		Au Bon Pain
While nothing trumps marinara in the battle for a better dip, cream cheese is a sweet option, safer than most others. Then, cut an extra 30 calories by asking them to prepare your pretzel sans butter.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/auntie-annes		Auntie Anne's
It’s nice that Baja makes all of its menu items fresh on-site, but why can’t it make a simple chicken burrito for under 600 calories? To minimize damage, turn to the tacos—then turn for the door.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/baja-fresh		Baja Fresh
Baskin-Robbins carries some of the worst frozen fare in the country. The Premium Sundae line averages 1,135 calories, and the average small Fruit Blast Smoothie contains 93 grams of sugars.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/baskin-robbins		Baskin-Robbins
All dairy is free from rBGH and the chocolate, vanilla, and coffee ingredients are all Fair Trade Certified. From a strictly nutritional standpoint, though, it’s still just an ice cream shop.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/ben-and-jerrys		Ben & Jerry's
The chain has removed trans fat from its menu, but Blimpie likes to splash oil on just about everything containing deli meat, and there are a handful of sinful subs that top the 1,000-calorie mark.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/blimpie		Blimpie
Bob Evans offers an array of great entrées and side options, but the menu is littered with land mines like 1,200-calorie multigrain pancakes and 1,000-calorie chicken salads. 	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/bob-evans		Bob Evans
The Cajun Spiced Chicken Breast may be the leanest piece of fried chicken you’ll find. For 278 calories, you get 33 grams of protein. Choosing wings or thighs instead will mean more fat, less protein.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/bojangles		Bojangles'
With sides containing 8 grams of saturated fat, Boston Market’s menu is headed in the wrong direction. It needs to revamp the Meatloaf, Pastry Top Chicken Pot Pie, and Boston Carver sandwiches.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/boston-market		Boston Market
Swapping out mayo, tartar sauce, or BK Stacker Sauce for ketchup, mustard, or A.1. is a good start. Pair one of the better sandwiches with a side salad, Apple Fries, or even a four-piece Tenders. 	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/burger-king		Burger King
The pastas, salads, and entrées are horrible, and the spaghettini ruins every meal it touches. The one bright spot on CPK’s rather dismal menu is the new-and-improved Small Cravings Menu. 	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/california-pizza-kitchen		California Pizza Kitchen
Bypass the Captain’s typical carb-loaded fare and combine a few items from the Add-a-Piece menu with a veggie side. A Chicken Tender and Stuffed Crab Shell with broccoli is only 310 calories.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/captain-ds		Captain D's
To balance out a menu with some of the worst burgers, Carl’s offers a line of grilled chicken sandwiches, salads, and the fast-food industry’s first successful line of turkey burgers.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/carls-jr		Carl's Jr.
The cost of tacking on meatballs to spaghetti? 570 calories. That’s like topping your pasta with an entire Big Mac. Opt for the Rustica Pizza, a guilty pleasure at 575 calories for half a pizza. 	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/carrabbas		Carrabba's
This place is unapologetic about its dangerously fat-tastic food. Until we see major changes, we’re going to continue to award the Cheesecake Factory the title of Worst Restaurant in America.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/the-cheesecake-factory		The Cheesecake Factory
Although Chevys claims to make most of its food fresh every day, getting a decent entrée here is next to impossible, so stick to the À la Carte menu—preferably crispy tacos or tamales.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/chevys-fresh-mex		Chevys Fresh Mex
Chick-fil-A ranks among the best of the country’s major fast-food establishments, thanks to a line of low-calorie chicken sandwiches and healthy sides like fruit cups and various salads.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/chick-fil-a		Chick-fil-A
Worst among the offenders are the burgers, fajitas, and appetizers, including the 2,100-calorie Texas Cheese Fries. The Guiltless Grill menu comes with only a handful of options.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/chilis		Chili's
We commend Chipotle for the integrity of its ingredients, but they could do better. Avoid meal-wrecking chips (570 calories), flour burrito tortillas (290 calories), and vinaigrette (260 calories).	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/chipotle-mexican-grill		Chipotle Mexican Grill
Church’s regular wings glisten with fat, but the boneless variety is three times as bad. You’ll get 75 percent of your daily trans-fat allotment (2 grams per day) in each Boneless Wing on the menu.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/churchs-chicken		Church's Chicken
You’ll slice 1,000 total calories from a 15-inch pizza if you order an Olé Pizza instead of the kid-friendly Macaroni & Cheese pie.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/cicis-pizza		CiCi's Pizza
The regular ice cream is fatty enough, but calorie counts escalate when the mix-ins and toppings come into play. Stick to sorbet, frozen yogurt, and Sinless Sans Fat ice cream.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/cold-stone-creamery		Cold Stone Creamery
Menu items that could shed some calories include a handful of sandwiches and salads; all of the melts, omelette sandwiches, muffins, and scones; and the flatbread pizzas, averaging 833 calories.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/cosi		Cosí
Our pick here is mashed potatoes and gravy for 140 calories. Per serving, potatoes display more antioxidant activity than pears, oranges, or grapes. Culver’s spuds are one of the best sides they have.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/culvers		Culver's
Bad burgers, bulging chicken baskets, and sweet concoctions leave room for error. A Mushroom Swiss Burger with regular onion rings and a small Snickers Blizzard will set you back 1,650 calories.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/dairy-queen		Dairy Queen
Del Taco comes out ahead for the best fast-food taco. Calorically, the Chicken Tacos Del Carbon are on par with the Fresco tacos from Taco Bell, but have less sodium, less fat, and more protein. 	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/del-taco		Del Taco
Just as they appeared to hit rock bottom with the Fried Cheese Melt (cheese sticks in a grilled cheese sandwich) and Baconalia (seven dishes of bacon), they bounced back with some Fit Fare entrées. 	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/dennys		Denny's
Domino’s Crunchy Thin Crust cheese pizza is still one of the lowest-calorie pies in America. Just avoid the breadsticks and Domino’s appalling line of pasta bread bowls and oven-baked sandwiches.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/dominos		Domino's
The DDSmart Menu introduced low-fat and protein-packed flatbread sandwiches. Now there’s no excuse to settle for bagels, muffins, or doughnuts, which are as bad as ever.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/dunkin-donuts		Dunkin' Donuts
Switch to Einstein’s hummus. Hummus is made from garbanzo beans, ground sesame seeds, and olive oil, so it packs the full gamut of healthy, hunger-fighting nutrients: fiber, protein, and healthy fats.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/einstein-bros-noahs		Einstein Bros./Noah's	Einstein Bros.
The Ultimate Pollo Bowl is like a Mexican buffet; by mass, it’s bigger than six whole chicken legs. Unless you’re looking for a meal to split, stick with one of the properly portioned regular bowls.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/el-pollo-loco		El Pollo Loco
Stay away from the Fazoli’s Submarino, which has more sodium than five large orders of Wendy’s French fries. Also avoid the garlic breadsticks, which will get you 300 calories deeper into caloric debt.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/fazolis		Fazoli's
Burgers range from 480 to 920 calories, so how you order can make a big difference. Keep your burgers small, choose your topping wisely, and skip the fries. Or choose the Veggie Sandwich.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/five-guys		Five Guys	Five Guys Burgers & Fries
Milk shakes liquefy a high-calorie, fast-digesting food to pack in even more calories and make it digest even faster. Switch to Sorbet Sippers, which run a more modest 300 to 470 calories each.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/haagen-dazs		Häagen-Dazs
Breakfast is a sordid affair of fat and refined carbs, while lunch and dinner are headlined by hyper-caloric sandwiches, salads, and chicken dishes. The best thing we can say is they have good sides.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/friendlys		Friendly's
Hardee’s offers one crazily caloric burger after the next (and fails to offer any breakfast options). The creation of lean turkey burgers provides diners with one alternative to squash their hunger.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/hardees		Hardee's
The specialty at Hooters is the greasy selection of chicken wings. Take a defensive approach by skipping the wing menu entirely and opting instead for a basket of fiery Buffalo Shrimp.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/hooters		Hooters
We were shocked when a New York City law forced them to post calorie counts: 1,000-calorie crepes, 1,200-calorie breakfast combos, and 1,700-calorie burgers. The F is for its closed-door policy.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/ihop		IHOP
You’ll find the usual burgers, fries, shakes, and sodas, but In-N-Out earns points for offering calorie-saving tweaks. The Protein-Style Burger replaces the bun with lettuce and saves 150 calories.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/in-n-out-burger		In-N-Out Burger
Jack in the Box’s menu still has changes that need to be made: Banishing anything in a bowl or burrito, offering more burgers with less than 500 calories, and eliminating partially hydrogenated oils. 	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/jack-in-the-box		Jack In The Box
Jamba Juice makes more than a few faux-fruit blends, weighed down with added sugars, but their menu has healthy options. Choose their Fruit & Veggie smoothies, as well as their low-calorie food menu. 	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/jamba-juice		Jamba Juice
Stick with the French bread. The intuitive move would be to switch to Jimmy’s 7-Grain Wheat, but the wheat bread, believe it or not, has 100 more calories than the French. 	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/jimmy-johns		Jimmy John's	Jimmy John's Gourmet Sandwiches
KFC’s menu of crispy bird bits are offset by skinless chicken pieces, low-calorie sandwich options, grilled chicken, and a host of sides that come from beyond the fryer. 	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/kfc		KFC
Its bagels are considerably better than most, and combined with a low-calorie coffee drink, make for a stronger beginning to your day than, say, a cream-filled doughnut.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/krispy-kreme		Krispy Kreme
The Little Caesars menu is nearly transfat-free. Their poorly designed dessert keeps them from being totally free of it. The Churros and accompanying chocolate sauce are loaded with harmful fat.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/little-caesars		Little Caesars
With healthy alternatives to trans fats, most restaurants switched to trans fat-free oils. If LJS followed, it would be one of the healthiest fast-food chains. Until then, it’s one of the worst.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/long-john-silvers		Long John Silver's
There are no winners when you’re choosing between noodles and rice. Even the steamed rice has more calories than nearly any entrée on the menu. Decline noodles or rice and order two entrées, instead. 	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/manchu-wok		Manchu WOK
While the trans fat is mostly gone, the number of calories reduced, and there are more healthy options, such as salads and yogurt parfaits, many breakfast and lunch items still top 500 calories.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/mcdonalds		McDonald's
The chicken and beef entrées are a mess, the seafood is swimming in sodium, and the average dinner-size plate of pasta packs 976 calories. All of this is before you tack on the breadsticks and salad. 	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/olive-garden		Olive Garden
The massive menu suffers from appetizers with 134 grams of fat, salads with a full day’s worth of sodium, and fish taco entrées with up to 2,240 calories. À la carte items offer the only real hope here.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/on-the-border		On the Border
Appetizers lurk in the 1,000 to 2,000 range, steaks and other cuts of meat routinely carry more than 800 calories, and the average side dish has more than 350 calories. Trouble abounds.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/outback-steakhouse		Outback Steakhouse
It’s not the wok-fried meat or the sauces that do the most harm—it’s the 400 calories of rice and noodles that form the foundation of each meal. Avoid them, and Panda Express looks a lot healthier. 	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/panda-express		Panda Express
Breakfast sandwiches top 650 calories and contain at least 10 grams of saturated fat. Calorie counts for their other sandwich lines have inched down, but only 4 out of 17 have 600 calories or fewer. 	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/panera-bread		Panera Bread
Very little separates Papa from the rest of the pizza competition. The breadsticks still deliver far too many calories and the Special Garlic sauce can wreck even the healthiest slice.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/papa-johns		Papa John's
Only five of the more than 90 dishes qualify for the “Calorie Counter” menu. Outside of that you’ll find entrées with more than 4,000 milligrams of sodium and pasta plates with over 100 grams of fat. 	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/perkins		Perkins
Noodle dishes and foods from the grill come with high fat and calorie counts, while traditional stir-fries are drenched with excess sodium. Chang’s does have a great variety of low-cal appetizers.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/pf-changs		PF Chang's
Pizza Hut expanded into pastas, salads, and the P’Zone, packing more than 1,200 calories a piece. Thin crust pizzas and the Fit ’N Delicious offer redemption with sub-200-calorie slices. 	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/pizza-hut		Pizza Hut
With newer entrées weighing in at fewer than 350 calories, it’s a commendable move, but the menu is still marred by oversized side dishes, trans fatty flare ups, and a lack of grilled chicken.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/popeyes		Popeyes
Bigger subs can easily supply a full day’s worth of saturated fat and close to 2 days’ worth of sodium. Sammies used to be the easy way out of trouble, but their calorie counts continue to climb.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/quiznos		Quiznos
The daily rotating fish specials are the centerpiece of a menu long on low-calorie, high-protein entrées and reasonable sides. That’s why Red Lobster is one of America’s healthiest chain restaurants. 	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/red-lobster		Red Lobster
Red Robin’s signature meal is about as bad as it gets. The average burger has an unacceptable 1,039 calories. The Natural is the only burger on the menu less than 600 calories.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/red-robin		Red Robin
After cutting calories and adding menu items such as rosemary spiedinis, far too many dishes still have at least 20 grams of saturated fat, and 21 entrées still carry more than 800 calories. 	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/romanos-macaroni-grill		Romano's Macaroni Grill	Macaroni Grill
Hamburgers average 91 grams of fat—about 150 percent of your recommended daily limit. With the addition of the Fit & Trim and Petite menus this year, Ruby’s earned a bump up on its report card.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/ruby-tuesday		Ruby Tuesday
Be careful how you use the word “gourmet” at Sbarro. Maybe all you want is a slice of cheese pizza, but if you order it gourmet, you’re looking at 200 extra calories. Stick to New York Thin Crust.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/sbarro		Sbarro
Sometimes you want to eat like a kid, and the Double Cheese Pizza is a pretty safe way to do it. The “double cheese” refers to a mix of mozzarella and Parmesan, not a layer of grease.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/schlotzskys		Schlotzsky's
Smoothie King suffers from portion problems. The smallest adult option is 20 ounces. Still, the menu boasts some great all-fruit smoothies, light options, and an excellent array of smoothie enhancers.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/smoothie-king		Smoothie King
Sonic offers an oversized selection of deep-fried sides, frozen sodas, shakes, malts, and Sonic Blasts. They do have smaller portions: a Jr. Burger with Small Tots and Small Slush for 630 calories.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/sonic		Sonic
A solid line of breakfast and lunch sandwiches with oatmeal, parfaits, and snack plates make this coffee shop a reliable place for a growling stomach on the go. Ignore the carb-fueled confections. 	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/starbucks	1070527	Starbucks
A single Steakburger with Cheese delivers a modest 330 calories, and not a single salad exceeds 500. Too bad we can’t say the same about the shakes. Even the smalls commonly eclipse 600 calories.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/steak-n-shake		Steak 'n Shake
Subway cut sodium by 15 percent in its regular sandwiches and 28 percent in its Fresh Fit sandwiches. If it weren’t already America’s healthiest chain, it certainly is now.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/subway		Subway
While we salute Friday’s for its smaller-portions menu, the remaining menu is awash in atrocious appetizers, frightening salads, and entrées with embarrassingly high calorie counts.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/tgi-fridays		TGI Friday's
Combining two things with bad nutritional reputations— Mexican food and fast food—Taco Bell provides ways to keep meals under 500 calories. Stick to the Fresco Menu (no item exceeds 350 calories). 	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/taco-bell		Taco Bell
Not a single lunch sandwich tops 500 calories, and its worst breakfast item is a 550-calorie sausage, egg, and cheese bagel. Supplement a lighter sandwich with oatmeal, yogurt, or soup. 	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/tim-hortons		Tim Hortons
Uno strikes a curious balance between oversized sandwiches and burgers, lean grilled steaks and fish entrées, and calorie-dense deep dish pizza. Far too many dishes here pack 1,000 calories or more.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/uno-chicago-grill		Uno Chicago Grill
Wendy’s offers a handful of Jr. Burgers that don’t go far above 300 calories, and chili and mandarin oranges offer side-order variety. Avoid the desserts and the double- and triple-patty burgers.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/wendys		Wendy's
Think fish is better? The Whatacatch Dinner, two fish patties drenched in partially hydrogenated oil and served alongside a medium order of fries, is easily the transfattiest meal on the menu.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/whataburger		Whataburger
The Surf and Turf Sandwich, two beef patties and a fish patty on a single bun, is only worth considering because of White Castle’s small portions. At 340 calories, limit yourself to just one.	http://www.menshealth.com/ETNT-mobile/white-castle		White Castle
